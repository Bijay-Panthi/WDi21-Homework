<h1>Nucleotides</h1>

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
<br>
Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.
<br>
<br>
Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

<ul>
  <li> twigs are to birds nests as</li> 
  <li> nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as</li> 
  <li> amino acids are to proteins as</li> 
  <li> sugar is to starch as</li> 
  <li> oh crap lipids</li>
</ul>

<br>
I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.
<br>
<br>
So back to nucleotides:
<br>
There are 5 types of nucleotides. 4 of these occur in DNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. 4 occur in RNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, `U`.
<br>
There are no other nucleotides.
<br><br>
Make sure that you validate it has nucleotides!
<br>
Find how many of each nucleotides are in a string that you pass in to a function
